# mf
Make file. A simple utility to generate a file or multiple empty files.

Designed to be compiled on UCRT MSYS2 for Windows 11, but really could compile
on pretty much any unix-style terminal.

To build run make, the binary will be in bin/

To run...
	./mf.exe file_name_1 file_name_2 ...
	or if you copy it to your system path you can just do...
	mf file_name_1 file_name_2 ...

Primarily used as a project templating tool.
